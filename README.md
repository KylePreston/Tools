### Levenshtein Distance

The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. This has a wide range of applications, for instance, spell checkers, correction systems for optical character recognition, and software to assist natural language translation based on translation memory.

### Beautiful Soup

Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing HTML documents (including having malformed markup, i.e. non-closed tags, so named after Tag soup). It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, so this library is useful for web scraping â€” extracting data from websites.
